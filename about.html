## About

In 2012, I started attending Smithtown High School East in Saint James, New York as an honors student. There, I joined the school’s FIRST Robotics team’s annual efforts as head programmer from 2012 until 2015. As head programmer, I was responsible for organizing a group of high school students to develop software for our annual robot project, as well as creating a more state of the art team website (<a href="http://www.smithtownrobotics.com">www.smithtownrobotics.com</a>) and to encourage students to create a team app for use at competitions (link TBD). From 2013, I am the manager of robot control system development. Under my lead, the software and hardware infrastructures both went under a sizeable improvement; electrical components and wiring was thought out as part of the entire robot design, and the software components were easier to access and edit with the use of formal version control (<a href="http://www.github.com/team810">www.github.com/team810</a>). I have also increased the scope of volunteer work for team members through connections with the local libraries and middle school robotics competition organizations. 

Under the encouragement and mentorship of Smithtown technology teacher Laurie O’Neill, I am currently one of the only students in the entire school district that holds a CompTIA A+ 801/802 IT certification. I plan on earning CompTIA’s Network+ certification during the school year.

Outside of my STEM high school career, I am a musician. I play string bass in my school’s symphonic orchestra, and am earning my diploma in social music through the American College of Musicians for piano performance.
